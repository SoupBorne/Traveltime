**Travel Time - Work In Progress

Traveltime is a program to gather travel time data from different locations to a central location. My purpose for creating this is to see which parts of Huntsville have the longest commutes to the Redstone Arsenal Gateway at various times of day.
This will help inform my future apartment and housing decisions.
